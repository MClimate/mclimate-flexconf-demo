# MClimate API Integration example

A barebones React.js app using react-router & axios.

## Running Locally

Make sure you have [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) installed.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/MClimate/mclimate-flexconf-demo.git # or clone your own fork
cd mclimate-flexconf-demo
```

Before running the app, you have to insert your CLIENT_ID and CLIENT_SECRET in the config file (src/constants/config.js).
CLIENT_ID and CLIENT_SECRET can be generated on the [developers portal](http://developers.seemelissa.com/)

```sh
npm install
npm start
```

Your app should now be running on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/).
